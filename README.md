# SmallBizTooling
A collection of small business tools. A big focus on OPEN-SOURCE and FREE. I do my best to make the setup simple.

The project revolves around an inventory management system. This application system, I wish to have run on Linux and be able to use devices like a an IPhone or a Barcode scanner to bring items into the inventory record via Universal Product Codes (UPC) code scan.

I will need to understand the following:
- How does reading Universal Product Codes (UPC) bring up information once scanned? Will I need to write a python script to read this information into a databse?
- What type of database would be best for handling inventory? MySQLite? Is a relational database enough or should I have a different sort of database?
- I need to either find a free, open-source productivity tool that can be the basis for the inventory tracking. Or, I should build my own. How? I will need this tool to be able to read in data from the UPC python script. Then, store it in the database. On sale (or other admin functions), I need the application to be able to remove the item from the DB via SQL Transactions.
